# PassWord_generator


A password generator is a tool designed to create strong, random, and secure passwords for users. These passwords typically include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters, making them difficult for others to guess or crack. Password generators can be used to enhance online security by ensuring that each password is unique and complex, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to personal accounts or sensitive information.
